I have been using Claude for general understanding and planning of the assignement, as well as Cursor's agent for codebase specific help and clarification.

## Examples of planning with Claude:

### 1. Flexible Data Handling

**Prompt:** "The API can return different fields depending on the PDF. Make a flexible data table that adapts to whatever fields are present, not hardcoded columns"

**Output:** Dynamic DataTable component with field detection and normalization

```
Help me understand the assignment correctly. User case is the following:

"I work as a technical advisor for dairy farms. A big part of my day is spent collecting and reviewing milk production information directly at the farm.
Most of this information comes in documents: production reports, lab results, delivery
summaries, usually as PDFs generated by different systems or sent by different providers.
Each one looks different, and none of them are particularly easy to work with.
When I’m on-site, I often need to quickly understand how production is evolving, check
specific values, or compare data from different days or sources. Today, this usually means
opening several documents, scrolling through tables, and manually taking notes.
The situation gets worse because many farms have poor or no internet connection. Even
so, I still need to access production data that I’ve already collected before, without
depending on connectivity at that moment.
I’m not a technical person and I don’t want to deal with complex tools. I just need a more
practical and reliable way to gather and review milk production information from my mobile
device, as part of my daily work."

My implementation is done according to the mock_data file(for fields and columns related to it only), do you think the table of content is made correctly? Because as I see it now there might be different types of data, not just "total_litres", "fat_percentage" and "protein_percentage", but some other ones.
Shouldn't DataTable components be universal for different types of tables of content?
```

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness

**Prompt:** "Make the app mobile-first with responsive Tailwind classes for tablets and phones"

**Output:** Responsive grid layouts, mobile-optimized spacing, touch-friendly buttons

### 3. Data Visualization

**Prompt:** "Create a Recharts line chart that handles dynamic fields and is mobile-responsive"

**Output:** ProductionChart component with ResponsiveContainer

## Reasoning for AI Usage

This challenge explicitly permits AI tool usage with the requirement to document it transparently. I leveraged Claude to:

1. **Accelerate Development** - Complete a week-long assignment in hours
2. **Ensure Best Practices** - TypeScript patterns, React hooks, error handling
3. **Mobile Optimization** - Responsive design patterns
4. **Problem-Solving** - Handling variable API responses, async polling logic

The AI acted as a senior developer pair-programmer, but all architectural decisions and business logic interpretations were mine.
