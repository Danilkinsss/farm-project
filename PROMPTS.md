I have been using Claude for general understanding and planning of the assignment, as well as Cursor's agent for codebase-specific help and clarification.

## Examples of planning with Claude:

### 1. Flexible Data Handling

**Prompt:** "The API can return different fields depending on the PDF. Make a flexible data table that adapts to whatever fields are present, not hardcoded columns"

**Output:** Dynamic DataTable component with field detection and normalization

```
Help me understand the assignment correctly. User case is the following:

"I work as a technical advisor for dairy farms. A big part of my day is spent collecting and reviewing milk production information directly at the farm.
Most of this information comes in documents: production reports, lab results, delivery
summaries, usually as PDFs generated by different systems or sent by different providers.
Each one looks different, and none of them are particularly easy to work with.
When I’m on-site, I often need to quickly understand how production is evolving, check
specific values, or compare data from different days or sources. Today, this usually means
opening several documents, scrolling through tables, and manually taking notes.
The situation gets worse because many farms have poor or no internet connection. Even
so, I still need to access production data that I’ve already collected before, without
depending on connectivity at that moment.
I’m not a technical person and I don’t want to deal with complex tools. I just need a more
practical and reliable way to gather and review milk production information from my mobile
device, as part of my daily work."

My implementation is done according to the mock_data file(for fields and columns related to it only), do you think the table of content is made correctly? Because as I see it now there might be different types of data, not just "total_litres", "fat_percentage" and "protein_percentage", but some other ones.
Shouldn't DataTable components be universal for different types of tables of content?
```

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness

**Prompt:** "Make the app mobile-first with responsive Tailwind classes for tablets and phones"

**Output:** Responsive grid layouts, mobile-optimized spacing, touch-friendly buttons

### 3. Data Visualization

**Prompt:** "Create a Recharts line chart that handles dynamic fields and is mobile-responsive"

**Output:** ProductionChart component with ResponsiveContainer

## Examples of execution with Cursor:

### 4. API Data Transformation Layer

**Prompt:** "The API returns data in a different format than our app expects. Create a transformation function that maps API response fields to our internal data structure, handling any fields that might be present"

**Output:** `transformApiData()` function that converts `ApiResponse` to `ProductionData[]` with field tracking, handles ordinal-to-month conversion, and preserves all fields in their original API order

**Technical Challenge:** Needed to maintain type safety while allowing flexible field structures, ensuring the transformation layer doesn't break when API adds new fields

### 5. Chart Scale Incompatibility Solution

**Prompt:** "When displaying litres (45,000) and percentages (3.85) on the same chart, the percentages become invisible due to scale mismatch. How should we handle this?"

**Output:** Separate chart per field approach — each numeric field gets its own chart with independent Y-axis scaling, making all data visible regardless of value ranges

**Technical Challenge:** Solved data visualization problem where different measurement scales couldn't coexist on a single chart without losing visibility of smaller values

### 6. Y-Axis Domain Optimization

**Prompt:** "Small differences like 3.2% vs 3.3% aren't visible when Y-axis goes from 0-10. Calculate appropriate Y-axis domains that focus on the actual data range"

**Output:** `calculateYAxisDomain()` function that computes min/max from data, adds padding, rounds to clean values, and a `formatTickValue()` formatter to avoid floating-point artifacts on tick labels

**Technical Challenge:** Balancing between showing meaningful differences and displaying clean tick values without floating-point precision issues (e.g. 3.8499999)

### 7. Reactive Offline Indicator

**Prompt:** "The offline indicator only checks navigator.onLine once at render. Make it reactive so it updates when connectivity changes"

**Output:** Added `online`/`offline` event listeners in a `useEffect` cleanup pattern, with `isOnline` state driving the UI banner

### 8. Shared Formatting Utilities

**Prompt:** "formatFieldName is duplicated in Chart.tsx and DataTable.tsx. Extract shared helpers and add defensive formatting for imperfect data (null, NaN, missing values)"

**Output:** Created `src/utils/format.ts` with `formatFieldName()` and `formatCellValue()` — both components now import from there. `formatCellValue` handles null, undefined, and NaN with dash placeholders

## Reasoning for AI Usage

This challenge explicitly permits AI tool usage with the requirement to document it transparently. I leveraged Claude and Cursor to:

1. **Accelerate Development** — Complete the assignment efficiently
2. **Ensure Best Practices** — TypeScript patterns, React hooks, error handling
3. **Mobile Optimization** — Responsive design patterns for on-site mobile use
4. **Problem-Solving** — Handling variable API responses, async polling logic
5. **Data Architecture** — Designing flexible transformation layers for variable API schemas
6. **Visualization Challenges** — Solving scale incompatibility and Y-axis precision problems
7. **Code Quality** — Extracting shared utilities, defensive data handling, clean component structure

The AI acted as a senior developer pair-programmer, helping with implementation details and technical problem-solving, but all architectural decisions and business logic interpretations were mine.
